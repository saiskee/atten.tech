Atten.Tech is an eye - tracking and reading behavior analysis platform that uses data gathered from your behavior during studying, memorizing, preparing etc. in order to help you out by suggesting parts of the text you should revise.

Let's say you're a student struggling in a class. There's just a lot of material to go over. Enter Atten.Tech. It'll track your study habits and let you know what's slipping through and make sure you've gotten all the content down.

Say you're an educator. You want to know why your students are underperforming. Why are they not able to hone in on some concepts? Enter Atten.Tech. Use the software to see what parts of the material seem to be more challenging to students, not by their own testimonials, but by raw data analysis.

Say you're a designer. Your website traffic is not as high as you hoped. The ad revenue is just can't seem to stop going down. Enter Atten.Tech. The software can tell you what areas of your webpages draw more attention and have a higher impact on the user.
